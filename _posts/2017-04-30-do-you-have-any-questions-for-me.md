title: Do you have any questions for me?
---
I'm not one to prepare for every eventuality in a job interview, so I usually
answer the titular question with a simple "no" unless I have an absolute burning
desire to know something about the company or the interviewer. It's probably
for the best that I didn't read up on "do you have a question for me" ahead of
time, because most guides I've read online view it as yet another way for the
interviewer to judge the job seeker and would have advised me to stick to
variations on "how can I be awesome for this position?".

Nor have I interviewed any prospective software engineers in my career.
I've known enough people who did, though, to be able to say with relative
confidence that they aren't looking to judge the candidate with that question.
They use their regular interview question to find out if the candidate can
do the job, but at the end they genuinely want to help the job seeker find
out more about the job &ndash; at least if the candidate wasn't a complete dud.

has stated that he even tries to sell the company on candidates he intends to
reject, just so they leave with a positive impression.)

I don't know if I'm cut out to be an interviewer, and so much has been written
about interviewing software developers that I wouldn't have much to write about
if I were. But I have been a software *interviewee* many times in my career and
will likely continue to do so (I probably won't stay at my current position for
the next 30 years). As such, I have amassed quite a few questions that I would
like to ask my interviewers, and I will share them over the next few posts.

As I move along in my career, I am certain I'll find more questions to ask, and
I'll either update these lists or make new addendum posts. I'm pretty sure the
list I use now will not be the same as the list I will use ten years down the
line, or possibly even ten months down the line.

Quick note to recruiters who read this and think "I'd never hire someone who asks
me all these questions": *Good*. I'll go work for someone else. Feel free not
to send me recruiting emails.

Next time: perhaps the most important thing to me, as a developer...

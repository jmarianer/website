Welcome to my blog in the Interwebz! The main page of my site already explains
who I am, so I will take this inaugural post to explain why I'm doing this.

I started a C# job last April, having never written C# before in my life, so
I'm learning as I go along. Simultaneously I discovered Node.js and Typescript,
which I'm also learning as I go along. In this blog I will share some
interesting tidbits I discover as I learn new stuff. I'm certain that some of
what I post will be old news, and some of it will be subtly wrong; I'll try to
post addenda and corrections as I learn more and more stuff.

I also intend to use this as a platform for rants. Consider yourselves warned.

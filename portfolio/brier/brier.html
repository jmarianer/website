      <h1>Welcome to the city of Brier</h1>
      <p>Brier is a small, suburban, residential town located 15 miles north of
      Downtown Seattle, in Snohomish County. The population is approximately
      6,300. The City government consists of about 19 employees, working in
      three public services departments. Brier is 2.13 square miles with
      approximately 27 miles of streets and roads.</p>
      <p>Throughout the City of Brier's history, development has resulted in an
      environment characterized by large homesites, wooded areas and semi-rural
      in nature. The philosophy of the City is to continue to retain and
      maintain the basic, original, spacious and semi-rural wooded character of
      the areas and to remain relatively small, simple and intimate, with a
      minimum of regulation and taxation. It is intended that future
      development of Brier will be consistent and harmonious with the
      established pattern.</p>
      <p>The overall goal of the city government is to preserve the existing
      character of The City of Brier as a single-family residential community,
      placing emphasis on the preservation of open space and natural
      landscape.</p>

    <div class="description">
      As part of my <a href="http://trydesignlab.com">DesignLab</a> course, I reimagined the <a href="http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/">homepage for my town</a> with a more modern look. I have made available a <a href="brier/Brier Wireframe.png">wireframe</a>, some <a href="brier/Brier V2.png">intermediate</a> <a href="brier/Brier V5.png">versions</a>, and the <a href="brier/Brier V6.png">final design</a>, and will soon make available a fully-functional HTML version.

    <div class="description">
      I made this app to help my family solve crosswords collaboratively across multiple timezones. Since there is only one user (myself) who creates crosswords, the <a href="http://crosswords.joeym.org/create/English">create workflow</a> is not as nice as it could be. The <a href="http://crosswords.joeym.org/puzzle/5a00c4a65a28b7001c9a31f7">solving page</a> is used by multiple people (where "multiple" is defined as "five"), so it is somewhat nicer.

    <div class="title">Bricks puzzle solver</div>
    <div class="image"><img src="bricks.png" height="200px" /></div>
    <div class="description">
      As an exercise in functional programming, I wrote a solver for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiveminlab.brickscape&hl=en">Brickscape</a>. The solver is written in Elm and compiled to JavaScript. An upcoming edition of the solver will include a server, written in Haskell, which will decrease solve times and also avoid running on the UI thread. <a href="http://bricks-demo.joeym.org/">Link to solver</a>.

    <div class="description">
      A game we used to play in person involving drawing pictures and
         describing them. During COVID lockdowns I created an online version of
         this, which we then continued to use online because a lot of us live
         in different places around the country. I recently updated it to use
         React, and also made the design mobile-friendly and prettier (with lots of help from Claude).
         The game is available at <a href="https://passthepic.com">passthepic.com</a>. The
         source code is on <a
         href="https://github.com/jmarianer/website/tree/main/boobtree">GitHub</a>.

    <div class="image"><img src="combinators.png" width="200px" /></div>
    <div class="description">
      Inspired by the game <a href="https://www.euclidea.xyz">Euclidea</a> and
      the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird">To
      Mock a Mockingbird</a>, I wrote the beginnings of a game about
      combinators. Players solve riddles such as divising the I combinator from
      S and K. The source code is on <a
      href="https://github.com/jmarianer/website/tree/main/combinators">GitHub</a>.
      There are only a few levels at the moment and the game definitely lacks
      polish, but I am nonetheless proud of it and think it's cool.

    <div class="description">
      I was watching a YouTube video about Factorio Space Exploration, and I
      wanted to be able to see the tech tree. This evolved into extracting all
      the item icons, recipes and even some animations. The backend (icon and
      animation extraction) is written in Python with a tiny bit of Lua glue
      code. The front end is React. The source code is on <a
      href="https://github.com/jmarianer/factorio-tech-tree">GitHub</a>.

    <div class="description">
      As part of my <a href="http://trydesignlab.com">DesignLab</a> course, I
      reimagined the <a href="http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/">homepage for my
      town</a> with a more modern look. I have made available a <a
      href="brier/Brier Wireframe.png">wireframe</a>, some <a href="brier/Brier
      V2.png">intermediate</a> <a href="brier/Brier V5.png">versions</a>, and
      the <a href="brier/Brier V6.png">final design</a>. I have also rendered
      the <a href="brier/brier.html">front page in HTML</a>.

    <div class="title">Collaborative crossword app</div>
    <div class="image"><img src="crossword.png" /></div>
    <div class="description">
      I made this app to help my family solve crosswords collaboratively across
      multiple timezones. Since there is only one user (myself) who creates
      crosswords, the <a
      href="https://crosswords.joeym.org/create">create workflow</a> is
      not as nice as it could be. The <a
      href="https://crosswords.joeym.org/crossword/-OX7mTBhgcHw5gzLtpvY">solving
      page</a> is used by multiple people (where "multiple" is defined as
      "five"), so it is somewhat nicer. The source code is on <a
      href="https://github.com/jmarianer/website/tree/main/crosswords">GitHub</a>.
      I wrote every line of code myself, but <a href="http://claude.ai">Claude</a>
      helped with the design.

      After wasting a weekend on <a
      href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal
      Paperclips</a>, and in my Elm-fueled frenzy, I decided to write a clone in
      Elm. The source code is on <a

    <div class="title">Bricks puzzle solver</div>
    <div class="image"><img src="bricks.png" height="200px" /></div>
    <div class="description">
      As an exercise in functional programming, I wrote a solver for <a
      href="https://brickscape.5minlab.com">Brickscape</a>. The UI is written in
      Elm and compiled to JavaScript. The server, including the solver, is
      written in Haskell. The source code is on <a
      href="https://github.com/jmarianer/bricks-demo">GitHub</a>. It doesn't
      look nice because the main aim was to write a decent solver in Haskell,
      not the UI.

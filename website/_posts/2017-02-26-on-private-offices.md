title: On private offices
---
There have been plenty of studies showing private offices increase developer
productivity, and plenty of other studies showing the opposite. This is a hard
thing to quantify, because, unlike [the effect of a too-small hard
disk](git-large-objects), the effects are not immediate and obvious;
productivity, whether it increases or decreases, will only do so over a long
period of time.

I am here to offer my opinion on the subject: **it does not matter**.

Let me be honest: I don't care whether it increases productivity or not. When
searching for a job, I look at a variety of signals: salary, perks,
health insurance, and yes, office layout. All these need to be weighed
carefully: what's better, $500k a year with horrible health insurance or $200k,
no deductibles and free gourmet meals? The answer will vary quite a bit from
individual to individual.

I have chosen to place a high weight on the office layout: I am (lucky enough to be)
in a position to state categorically that I will not accept a software
engineering position that requires me to work in an open office environment.

Productivity doesn't factor into it at all.

=============
Welcome to my home on the Interwebz! Sparse, I know, but I'm a man of few words.

I have been a professional software developer since high-school (I am now in my
thirties) in a variety of roles â€“ backend, frontend and even some low-level
hardware stuff. I have a bachelor's degree in math and CS, and I took
graduate-level courses but never finished my degree. Learning cool stuff is
nice, but fighting the bureaucracy in academia was not.

It turns out one can learn stuff without fighting with academia. At Google, I
learned how to be a site reliability engineer at Google. At Instructure, I
learned how to upgrade a major dependency (Rails) with minimal fuss. At Rescale
I learned how to lead project with a small group of peers.

I am, of course, always on the lookout for interesting new opportunities. I'm
happy to continue working on the backend or in devops/SRE-land, but I'm even
happier if I can learn something new. Down-stack (networking, bare-metal,
compilers) or up-stack (front-end) would be equally welcome as a change of
scenery.

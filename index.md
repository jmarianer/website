Welcome to my home on the Interwebz! Sparse, I know, but I'm a man of few words.

I have been a professional software developer since high-school (I am now in my thirties) in a variety of roles â€“ backend, frontend and even some low-level hardware stuff. I am always on the lookout for interesting new opportunities. While my interests have varied over the years, I currently find myself interested primarily in frontend and UX work.

My most recent employer was Google. Google enjoys open office plans, which I could live with (even though I hate them); but they also enjoy continuously shrinking the amount of space per person, up tp the point that I got fed up. My current employer is Microsoft, who offered me a private office (with a door!). **Please don't contact me about employment unless you're willing to offer me the same.**

My bachelor's degree is in math and CS. I took graduate-level courses but never finished my degree. Learning cool stuff is nice, but fighting the bureaucracy in academia was not.

Side projects
-------------
- I recently took an introductory course in UI design and built a small [portfolio](#).
- I enjoy solving crossword puzzles with family members around the word, so I made a [collaborative crossword app](#). This was written in Node.js and deployed with Heroku; the source code is on [Github](#).
- I am working on a [list of questions to ask at job interviews](#) from the candidate's side.
- In an effort to learn Haskell, I am working through [Project Euler in Haskell](#).
- I use this very site to experiment with technologies such as [Jekyll](#), [SASS](#) and [bootstrap.css](#). The source code for this site is on [GitHub](#), and it is served using [GitHub Pages](#).

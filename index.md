Welcome to my home on the Interwebz! Sparse, I know, but I'm a man of few words.

I have been a professional software developer since high-school (I am now in my
thirties) in a variety of roles â€“ backend, frontend and even some low-level
hardware stuff. I have a bachelor's degree in math and CS, and I took
graduate-level courses but never finished my degree. Learning cool stuff is
nice, but fighting the bureaucracy in academia was not.

It turns out one can learn stuff without fighting with academia. My favorite
thing to learn was how to be a site reliability engineer at Google.  I'm
currently working for Microsoft, attempting to apply some of what I learned to
a team inside Bing.

I am, of course, always on the lookout for interesting new opportunities. While
my interests have varied over the years, I currently find myself interested
primarily in frontend and UX work... but anything interesting and outside of
the norm is at least worth considering.

Side projects
-------------
- I recently took an introductory course in UI design and built a small [portfolio](#).
- I enjoy solving crossword puzzles with family members around the word, so I made a [collaborative crossword app](#). This was written in Node.js and deployed with Heroku; the source code is on [Github](#).
- I am working on a [list of questions to ask at job interviews](#) from the candidate's side.
- In an effort to learn Haskell, I am working through [Project Euler in Haskell](#).
- I use this very site to experiment with technologies such as [Jekyll](#), [SASS](#) and [bootstrap.css](#). The source code for this site is on [GitHub](#), and it is served using [GitHub Pages](#).
